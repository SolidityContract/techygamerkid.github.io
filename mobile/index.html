<h1>The home for all techygamerkid tech and projects!</h1>

<p>Visit projects like YHub, a better version of YouTube. Come to the Arcade to play amazing and emulated flash/js games! Read up on your favorite tech and opinions in the News section ad free!</p>
<br>
<h1>YHub, a tool for content creators. (Coming Soon)</h1>
<br>
<p>YHub, our new project, is designed to combat YouTube's system by whitelisting creators and mods that upload videos manually to the platform. Partners can spread their content through their own designed platform on YHub or a default one. You can also customize ads to display coming in the future, while we may only get cut on our ads we display and a visit to our site. We also rarely have censors, demonetization problems, or copyright because of the whitelist and the fact that content is more freed. Don't worry about your content too much, you may have to keep it a bit safe for viewing to stay on the platform, but advertisers can only review your content if they find your site.</p>
<br>
<h1>Arcade, play addicting and fun games from your browser!</h1>
<br>
<p>At the arcade, we post high quality games that are very popular. Since we host this page on GitHub, your school cannot block it easily without blocking our specific site. We host games from ninjakiwi, myself, and others. In the near future, we plan to make more of these games mobile, and as many games require flash but are shutting down, more devices will be supported. We plan to one day make it inclusive with tutorials and related content on YouTube.
<br>
<h1>News, a divine source for tech related news and opinions</h1>
<br>
<p>News is a blog from techygamerkid that talks about tech related news, tutorials, and opinions. There are also exclusive articles unlike techygamerkid YouTube content but some that match the videos while providing you more coverage. These articles go in depth, too, so indulge in new content covering old and new topics.</p>
<br>
